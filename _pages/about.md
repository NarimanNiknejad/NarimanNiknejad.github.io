I’m a third-year Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Michigan State University. My research brings together data-driven set-based methods (ellipsoids, zonotopes) and prior system knowledge to design safe, robust, and optimal control strategies for autonomous and robotic systems. I work on:

- **Model Predictive Control**   
- **Perception-based Observers** 
- **Data-driven Control** 

I’m passionate about bridging theory and practice: implementing MPC on ROS 2 robots such as ROSbot 2R and ROSbot XL, and developing simulation pipelines (Gazebo).

# Selected Experience

## Research & Development  
**Dynamics & Controls Lab, MSU** (Jan 2023 – Present)  
- Physics-augmented data-driven controller design  
- Regret-bounded reference tracking algorithms
- Zonotopic descriptions for safety, stability, and system description
- Gazebo/ROS 2 simulations for ship-deck and differential-drive robots  

**AgCypher Lab, Auburn University** (Jan 2021 – Dec 2022)  
- AI-driven phenotyping of loblolly pine via stereo vision  
- Equine gait analysis using deep learning and 3D point-cloud processing  
- Autonomous field-robot development for precision agriculture
